# guessing (pwn300)
In this task we are given a x86\_64 ELF binary and libc.

### TL;DR
- Overwrite `got.plt.rand` to main address
- Overwrite least byte of string pointer in heap to get control of pointer itself then leak address of libc functions
- Overwrite `got.plt.exit` to simple return gadget
- Overwrite `got.plt.strlen` to `system`

 
 The logic of task is pretty simple - read two strings which buffers are allocated on the heap, then ask the user to guess 10 random numbers (this part of binary mostly useless).
 Input function:

 As we can see, the string can't be overflown in a simple way because of string length check... or it can? The trick is pretty simple - `gets` wouldn't stop reading from stdin if it reaches null-byte, but strlen would. So to bypass this check we simply need to send something like this `\x00 + payload`.
 Well now we can overflow strings and pass the check, considering the fact that our strings located continuously in heap like this:

 ```
 DWORD - length of string1
 4 BYTES - alignment
 QWORD - pointer to string1
 256 BYTES - string1 buffer
 DWORD - length of string2
 4 BYTES - alignment
 QWORD - pointer to string2
 256 BYTES - string2 buffer
 ```
Thus we can overwrite the pointer to string2 and gain arbitrary write. Things we want to overwrite:
 - Pointer to `libc_random` function to the address of `main` function to get few tries of writing/reading
 - Pointer to `libc_strlen` to `libc_system`
 - Pointer to `libc_exit` to something that JUST DON'T SCREW EXECUTION OF OUR PROCESS, purposes of this i'll describe a bit later

 To get arbitrary read we need:
 - With the first input_read overwrite the least byte of string2 pointer to null, so it makes string2 pointer to point in the middle of our string1 buffer
 - With the second input_read overwrite the whole string2 pointer to address of something you want to read, in this case it would .got.plt

 With arbitrary read and write and given `libc.so` file we can leak `libc_base` address and then overwrite `strlen` to `system`. And last but not least - as we overwrote strlen to the system it would probably be called with string pointed somewhere in `.got.plt` so it would return -1 or something, in this case we wouldn't pass length check so that's why we need to overwrite `exit` to something dummy.

 Here is my [exploit](./spl.py).
